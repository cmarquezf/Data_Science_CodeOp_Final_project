This is my Final Project from CodeOp Data Science bootcamp.

The dataset itÂ´s from Maven Analytics. It contains Churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company 
that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, 
and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

Find the [Final Presentation] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18SMTDCLt2RJJJDQwqneRUjxlpapuwqdehKqBPaOEA0E/edit#slide=id.p) here.

In this analysis I will try to address the following business questions:

* What is the typical profile for a customer that churned?
* What seem to be the key drivers behind churn?
* Is the company losing high value customers? 
* Can we predict whether a customer will churn, so we can target them with a special promotion?
* Can we segment the customers with the features we have? (WIP)
* Can we relate the segments we got with churning probability? (WIP)
